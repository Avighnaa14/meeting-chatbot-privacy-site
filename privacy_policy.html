  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <!-- insert date --> October 22, 2025</p>

  <p>Meeting Scheduler Chatbot collects the minimum data required to provide calendar scheduling features. We access users' Google Calendar only to read free/busy information and to create events on behalf of authenticated users. We use the user's email to link their account. Tokens are stored securely on our backend and are used only for calendar operations. We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google account email (to link accounts)</li>
    <li>Google OAuth tokens (stored securely to manage calendars)</li>
    <li>Application user profile (name, email)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to contact us</h2>
  <p>Contact: avighnaa@company.com</p>

  <p>We may update this policy — the latest version will always be posted on this page.</p>
